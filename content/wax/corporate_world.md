Welcome to the Corporate World (Hell on Earth)! Dan Tenferno felt something amiss when he joined **Herr E-tech Labs Limited Inc.** as their new employee. He has been experiencing "daily work-life unbalance". From what he gathers, the CEO's unique
aura has corrupted the long-time employees and morphed them into worst versions of themselves. Even the office equipments have a mind of their own! 


Will Dan survive this godforsaken place? Will he be corrupted, or will he escape?
