**Good News!** The Series 1 Worker and Executive Packs are now **SOLD OUT**! So production of series 2 characters is on the way! There will be more characters but will have the same rarities as Series 1 to keep it consistent. 

Series 2 will be entitled **The Perils of the Corporate World**!

<hr>


**Series 1 - Journey to The Corporate World Summary**

Welcome to the Corporate World (Hell on Earth)! Dan Tenferno felt something amiss when he joined **Herr E-tech Labs Limited** as their new employee. He has been experiencing "daily work-life imbalance". From what he gathers, the CEO's unique
aura has corrupted the long-time employees and morphed them into worst versions of themselves. Even the office equipments have a mind of their own! 


Will Dan survive this godforsaken place? Will he be corrupted, or will he escape?
