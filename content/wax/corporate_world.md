Welcome to the Corporate World (Hell on Earth)! Dan Tenferno felt something amiss when he joined BeelzeBoss
        Corp.
        as
        their new employee. He has been experiencing "daily work-life unbalance". From what he gathers, the CEO's unique
        aura has corrupted the long-time employees and morphed into worst versions of themselves. Even the office
        equipments
        have a mind of their own! Will Dan survive this godforsaken place? Will he be corrupted, or will he escape?
