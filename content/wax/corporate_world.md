Welcome to the Corporate World (Hell on Earth)! Dan Tenferno felt something amiss when he joined **Herr E-tech Labs Limited Inc.** as their new employee. He has been experiencing "daily work-life unbalance". From what he gathers, the CEO's unique

Will Dan survive this godforsaken place? Will he be corrupted, or will he escape?
